"""autogen.py -- the portraits GROW THEIR OWN POSES (Phase 2, AUTONOMOUS).

Flow:
  1. the heartbeat (director/heartbeat.py, propose-mode) writes PROPOSALS to
     data/mind/proposals.json -- a new pose the character wishes it had: a still
     prompt + a transition motion + a couple of idle motions. status=pending.
  2. NO APPROVAL STEP. Since 2026-08-09 the worker generates `pending` straight through:
     the portraits decide what they want and go get it. `--gated` restores human review.
  3. the worker builds the pose (Higgsfield by default -- see pipeline/hf_gen.py):
        still: gpt_image_2, anchored with --image to the CANONICAL hub still
        edge:  kling3_0 first->last, hub still -> new still
        back:  kling3_0 first->last, new still -> hub still   (GENERATED, never flipped)
        idles: kling3_0 with start == end, so the clip leaves and returns
        mp4 -> gif into data/clips/_proto/<char>_<edgelabel>_v0.gif
     then records the pose in data/mind/autogen_poses.json (which video_graph.build()
     merges atomically) and runs build. The walker hot-reloads and can now walk there.

WHY THE REVERSE IS GENERATED, NOT FLIPPED: the MJ path faked the return edge by playing
the forward clip backwards. It is free and it looks wrong -- reversed playback runs the
physics backwards, so cloth settles upward, flame flickers in reverse, and a figure rising
from a chair reads as being pulled into it. The graph is walked in BOTH directions, so both
directions get real motion. That is the whole reason first+last-frame generation was worth
moving to.

Guardrails -- these, not human review, are what make an unattended loop safe:
  * a CLIP budget: CLIP_DAILY_CAP across the system, CLIP_CHAR_CAP per character. 13/day
    x 7.5 credits x 30 days = 2925 against a 3000/month allowance, so the worst case the
    loop can reach is "spends the plan it was given" -- never twice.
  * budget is re-checked before EVERY clip, and the resume logic skips artifacts already on
    disk, so running out mid-pose costs nothing and the next run continues it.
  * EVERY prompt passes director.mj_safe.check first; a hard-block -> mark failed, NEVER
    submit, NEVER retry (retrying into a moderation block EXTENDS it).
  * single-flight: one generate run at a time (a lock file).
  * on a rate-limit or moderation-smelling error, STOP and record a cooldown rather than
    marching into more submits.

The Midjourney client + imageio are imported LAZILY inside the generate path, so this
module imports + the queue/budget/review CLI run anywhere (the dev box has no vendored
midjourney/). Atomic JSON writes throughout.

    Paying 8x the low tier for it is the same quality decision that chose kling3_0 over
    a 5-credit model in _bakeoff/README.md. Do not "optimise" it.

    The bug was that nothing could SEE it. Measured from gen_events.jsonl on the wall
    host 2026-09-08, across the fourteen healthy days since the last outage: a steady
    3 poses/day, so ~12 credits/day, ~360 a grant period. The guardrail sum at the top
    of this file omits that term, which is why 13 clips/day reads as 2925 of a 3000
    allowance while the real rate is ~102/day -- 29.4 days of runway for a month that
    is 30 or 31. The plan duly went dry on the 17th of the last period.

    What that cost was not money: failed renders are refunded (_bakeoff/README.md). It
    cost six days in which the wall generated nothing. Counting exists so the whole
    grant is spent evenly on output, NOT so that less of it is spent.

    Deliberately NOT part of CLIP_DAILY_CAP. That cap is a PACE, not a ceiling -- the

    grows, which is an artwork decision. This counts what the vendor charged, which is

    Differs from the MJ path in three ways that matter:

    * An edge is a FIRST->LAST interpolation, not a forward animation that hopefully lands
      near the target. Both endpoints are real stills, so continuity is structural.
    * Spend is metered PER CLIP, so the budget is checked before every single clip and the
      run stops cleanly when it runs out. Nothing is wasted: the resume logic below skips
      whatever is already on disk, so tomorrow's run continues this pose mid-way.
    * The REVERSE edge is GENERATED, not flipped. The MJ path could only animate forward, so
      it faked the return by playing the forward clip backwards -- and that looks wrong,
      because reversed playback runs the physics backwards: cloth settles upward, the candle
      flicker runs in reverse, a figure rising from a chair reads as being pulled into it.

      second clip and it is worth it -- every edge in the graph is walkable in both
      directions with motion that obeys gravity in both.
