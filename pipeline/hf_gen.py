"""hf_gen.py -- the Higgsfield generation backend (replaces Midjourney for new poses).

WHY THIS EXISTS: the clip graph stores poses as nodes and transitions as EDGES, and both
endpoints of an edge are stills we already have. Midjourney could only animate FORWARD from
one image and hope it landed near the target, which is why `pipeline/verify.py` carries a
`continuity(clip_end_frame, target_node_frame)` check at all. Higgsfield takes a first AND a
last frame, so an edge is generated as the interpolation it actually is -- landing on the
target node is structural, not lucky.

ROUTING: hil is NOT the Higgsfield session owner -- `node` is, and the session uses
one-time-use refresh tokens, so a second host running `hf` steals and kills the first's
session. Everything here therefore goes through the hf-proxy on node
(`j4me/infra/deploy/hf_proxy/`), which inlines files as base64 and shells to the pinned CLI.
NEVER run `hf` on hil.

The proxy's wire contract -- endpoints, the two rules it enforces, the error
taxonomy this client depends on -- is written out in HF_PROXY.md, so it can be
implemented without access to the service's source.

MODEL CHOICE (measured 2026-08-09, see ../_bakeoff/README.md):
  * stills  -> gpt_image_2 @ 1k       = 0.5 credits, and 1024x1024 is natively square
  * clips   -> kling3_0 @ 1:1/5s      = 7.5 credits with sound OFF (10 with it on)
`sound=off` is not a preference: the portraits speak through their own piper TTS
(`pipeline/tts.py`), so a baked audio track is dead weight that costs 2.5 credits an edge.

Credits are a MONTHLY pool (3000, granted on the 23rd, and NOT rolled over), so the caps in
autogen.py are the real safety net -- see CLIP_DAILY_CAP / CLIP_CHAR_CAP there.
