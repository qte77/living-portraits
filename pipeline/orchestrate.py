"""orchestrate.py -- the producer loop that drives one character from prompt to clip row.

This is the "orchestrate (producer)" box in living-portraits-architecture-v3.svg. It owns
no art and no rig math; it CHAINS the four stage modules and applies the verify gate's
register/quarantine policy, so a passing character lands in the clip library and a failing
one is parked with its reasons:

    generate.py  -> data/gen/<slug>_portrait.png   (SD 1.5 on SC2 -- HEAVY, guarded here)
    segment.py   -> <slug>_cutout.png + <slug>_bg.png + mask + backend + coverage
    rig_spec.py  -> <slug>_rig.json                (Live2D-style layer regions + warp)
    verify.py    -> Verdict {passed, checks, scores, reasons, degraded, skipped}
        |
        +-- pass  -> ClipGraph.add_clip(idle self-loop on the base pose) + graph.save()
        +-- fail  -> log the failing checks + quarantine (do NOT register)

Why a self-loop and not a transition: what the producer has actually MADE at this point is a
still portrait + a cutout + a rig spec -- NOT a baked video. The idle-on-pose held loop is the
one edge a character can claim immediately (its art exists; the player can render it
synthetically until img2vid bakes real footage). We register it with asset=None so the graph's
missing_edges() correctly keeps surfacing it as "owes real footage" -- exactly clip_graph's
SYNTHETIC-placeholder contract. The portrait/cutout/rig paths ride along as tags + the
character node's provenance, so clipsmith's manifest row carries who+where without inventing a
clip that has not been baked.

Pass policy is a FLAG (mirrors VERIFY_CONTRACT.md's kick-back loop):
    strict=True  (default) -> register only on a CLEAN pass: passed and NOT skipped and NOT
                              degraded. A degraded identity (no InsightFace) or a skipped
                              register (Ollama down) is a SOFT pass -> not-yet-registerable;
                              re-run on a host with full deps (SC2) or escalate.
    strict=False (lenient) -> register on any passed verdict, recording the soft-gate flags
                              (degraded/skipped) on the clip row so the soft gate is visible.

Import policy (mirrors the rest of the pipeline -- degrade, don't crash):
  * runtime.clip_graph is pure stdlib -> always imported at module load.
  * segment / rig_spec / verify need numpy+opencv (assumed present in the .venv); they are
    imported LAZILY so this module imports even where they are not, and a dry-run plan can
    still run and report which stages WOULD run.
  * generate needs torch + diffusers + the SD 1.5 weights (on SC2, not every box). It is
    HARD-guarded: we never import it at module load and never call its real renderer here.
    build_character only invokes generation when explicitly asked AND generate imports; the
    self-test never triggers a model download.

    python pipeline/orchestrate.py            # self-test: run the EXISTING phineas portrait
                                              # through segment+rig+verify, print the verdict +
                                              # whether it registered; dry-run plan if no portrait.
