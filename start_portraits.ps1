# start_portraits.ps1 -- one-click launcher for the Living Portraits show on desktop-hil08rd.
#
# Double-click "Start Living Portraits" on the Desktop. Brings the whole live stack back up:
#   OllamaServe          local qwen3 (Track-1 brain; idle unless the spoken asides are on)
#   lp-mind              the GLM heartbeat -- picks each character's next pose
#   lp-preview           the PLAYER that paints the two LED panels
#   lp-watchdog-preview  self-heal -- restarts the above if they exit cleanly
#
# Best-effort: enables a task if it was turned off, then starts it. No admin needed in the
# normal case (tasks are Ready); if a task was hard-Disabled, right-click -> Run as administrator.
