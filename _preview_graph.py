"""_preview_graph.py -- random-traversal living-portrait player driven by the VIDEO GRAPH.

Each panel sits on a character's anchor node and plays a RANDOM outgoing idle edge (its gif);
at the loop boundary it picks another random edge (avoiding an immediate repeat) -> endless,
non-repeating, varied idle pulled straight from data/clips/video_graph.json.

    pythonw _preview_graph.py --a phineas --b seraphina [--loops 1]

Borderless topmost at (0,0), session 1, same window pin as player.py. Reads gifs via PIL.
