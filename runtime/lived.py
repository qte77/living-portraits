"""lived.py -- what a character has actually LIVED, accumulated at runtime.

The audit's most damning structural finding was not that the graph was small. It was
that the graph is an ASSET MANIFEST: nodes are poses a generator made, edges are clips
it rendered, and **nothing a character experiences was ever written back into it**. The
graph accreted from a credit card, not from living.

This is the write-back half. Per character, per node: how many times it has stood there,
when it first did, when it last did, how long it has spent, and which mood-bands it
brought. Per edge: how many times that clip has actually played. That turns "255 nodes"
into a lived topography with hot paths and cold corners -- and it is the VALID-TIME half
of a bi-temporal graph (when a thing was true of the world), the sibling of the graph's
own provenance (when the system learned the thing exists).

WHY A SEPARATE FILE, not fields on the graph: `video_graph.build()` REGENERATES
video_graph.json from NODE_SPECS/EDGE_SPECS and overwrites it, and Phase-2 autogen rebuilds
roughly every 20 minutes. Anything written into that file by the runtime is destroyed on the
next pose the characters grow. So lived experience is its own store, single-writer per
character (that panel's walker), merged by readers. Same discipline as intent.json and
pose/<char>.json.

Written from the 10fps render loop, so: in-memory counters, a bounded flush interval, one
atomic tmp+replace per flush, and every failure swallowed. A panel must never go dark
because a statistics file could not be written.
