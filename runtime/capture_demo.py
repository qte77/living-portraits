"""
capture_demo.py -- headless GIF/PNG-montage proof that the panels are ALIVE.

A still screenshot of living-portraits proves nothing: a blink, a breath, a gaze
drift, and the cross-frame "walk out of one portrait, into the next" all only
read as MOTION over time. This tool renders the real 448x256 dual-panel stage
HEADLESS (no pygame, no window) for N seconds at a chosen FPS, drives a scripted
beat timeline -- idle -> a cross-frame walk A->B -> idle -- and assembles the
frames into a single shareable artifact the conductor can drop into a chat:

    data/gen/demo_<timestamp>.gif      (preferred -- animates)
    data/gen/demo_<timestamp>.png      (fallback contact-sheet -- still proves it)

What it composites (and why it's honest)
-----------------------------------------
Every panel is built through the SAME numpy path the live player uses, so the
demo cannot drift from the show:

  * the bg plate + figure are composited by stage_render.composite_art(...)
    (the exact production compositor -- _alpha_over over the <slug>_bg.png /
    _portrait.png plate, panel-size cover-resize, the lot);
  * the IDLE living layer is rig_loop.RigLoop.rig_frame_for(slug, t) -> the same
    (rgb, alpha) tuple stage_render takes as rig_frame= in player.py;
  * the WALK is crossframe.exit_frame / enter_frame / empty_layer driving a real
    crossframe.CrossFrameState through PHASE_EXIT -> PHASE_GAP -> PHASE_ENTER,
    fed to the same rig_frame= slot.

The only thing this module owns is the *timeline* (when to idle vs walk) and the
*frame assembly* (panels onto a 448x256 canvas, then -> GIF). It never blits with
pygame, never touches the network, and never imports the director or player.

Layout matches the physical LEDs (player.py:PANELS)
---------------------------------------------------
    Panel A : (0,   0) 256 x 256
    Panel B : (256, 0) 192 x 192     (top-aligned; the 256..448 x 192..256
                                      corner is LED-dark, kept black here too)

Assets
------
Prefers the real generated assets in data/gen/ (data/gen/<slug>_bg.png +
_cutout.png + _portrait.png + _rig.json). When a slug has no assets (a dev box
that never ran the SD pipeline), it SYNTHESISES a stand-in into a private temp
gen dir using rig.py's own _synth_cutout / _synth_spec_for fixtures -- so the
demo always produces a visual artifact and still exercises the true Rig +
compositor code paths. The output banner states which slug ran against real vs
synth assets so a reviewer is never misled.

GIF backend selection (import-guarded, always-an-artifact)
----------------------------------------------------------
    imageio  (preferred)  -> animated .gif
    PIL/Pillow            -> animated .gif
    neither               -> opencv horizontal PNG contact-sheet (every Kth
                             frame side by side). opencv + numpy are the only
                             hard deps; imageio/PIL are optional.
