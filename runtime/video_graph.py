"""video_graph.py -- the living-portraits VIDEO KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (v3, multi-node).

A graph of FRAMES (nodes) and VIDEO CLIPS (edges), tied by start/end frame, with the
generation PROMPTS carried as semantic metadata so the whole thing is agent-queryable:

  * node = a frame/POSE of a character, id "<char>:<pose>" (e.g. phineas:anchor,
           phineas:standing). Carries the still IMAGE + its `gen_prompt`.
  * edge = a video CLIP from a start-frame node to an end-frame node. Carries the
           panel `gif` + its `motion_prompt` + `kind`:
             - kind="idle"        : self-loop on a pose (MJ `--end loop`). Interchangeable;
                                    the player traverses them at random for varied idle.
             - kind="transition"  : pose A -> pose B (MJ `--end <frame_url>`). A *stand-up*
                                    is anchor->standing; the *sit-down* is its reverse,
                                    standing->anchor, closing the cycle pixel-perfectly.

Phineas now has TWO poses (anchor seated + standing) joined by stand-up/sit-down
transitions; the player random-walks the graph (idle a while, transition, idle a while,
transition back). Seraphina still has no second DAYTIME pose (anchor only; the other three
nodes are her bedtime chain) until she gets her own standing set.

Variants are DISCOVERED by globbing data/clips/_proto/<char>_<label>_v*.gif, so derived
clips (the reversed sit-down, which has no MJ job) are first-class. Stored at
data/clips/video_graph.json. Import-safe (stdlib only).
    python runtime/video_graph.py build
    python runtime/video_graph.py show
    python runtime/video_graph.py provenance

PROVENANCE (added 0.3.2). Every node and edge carries `created` -- the moment the SYSTEM
learned it exists, derived from its artifact's mtime, so it survives `build()` overwriting
this file every ~20 minutes. And an edge whose clip disappears is no longer SKIPPED into
oblivion: `build()` diffs against the last committed graph and tombstones what vanished, so
the graph can still answer "what could this character do last month". The tombstones live in
data/graph/provenance.json, NOT in video_graph.json -- that file stays a pure LIVE view
because `_preview_graph.py` reads it raw, and a dead edge in it is a dead clip handed to the
walker. `VideoGraph.load()` therefore defaults to the live view; `load(history=True)` is the
explicit opt-in that reassembles the dead. See runtime/graph_provenance.py.
