"""policy.py -- ONE weighted edge-selection policy for the living-portrait walk.

Replaces the old layered tug-of-war (circadian FORCES out / mind FORCES in / random
walk with a separate anti-pendulum guard the forced branches bypassed) with a single
softmax over the candidate edges, where every concern is a WEIGHT evaluated together:

  * anti-reverse   -- the reverse of the clip just played, and a transition straight
                      back to the pose we came from, are heavily down-weighted -> no
                      "play a move then run it backwards" pendulum (the #1 visible bug).
                      Applied in ALL cases, so a goal-walk or a leaf pose can't force it.
  * novelty        -- decaying recency over recently-PLAYED clips and recently-VISITED
                      poses -> the walk spreads across the graph instead of orbiting a hub
                      and cycling the same 1-2 idles.
  * goal-pull      -- a SOFT gradient toward the heartbeat's goal pose (BFS distance):
                      'beeline' pulls hard (~the old forced single step), 'wander' pulls
                      gently (drifts there scenically). Shares the circadian EXCLUDE mask,
                      so a daytime goal-walk is never routed THROUGH a bedtime pose (the
                      deadlock that pinned MAXX in an idle<->empty bounce).
  * mood           -- the heartbeat's chosen mood finally bends the BODY: restless -> more
                      transitions + novelty; weary -> more idles + longer dwell; fixated ->
                      fewer transitions (lingers). Personality becomes visible, not just
                      journaled.
  * style          -- OPT-IN (`styles=`). The mood picks HOW MANY transitions; this picks
                      WHICH ONE. `runtime/edge_style.py` reads each clip's own
                      `motion_prompt` into a manner (storm / saunter / collapse / rise /
                      ...) and a valence, and a weary character then prefers the clip that
                      sags over the clip that lunges -- both of which are `kind:
                      transition` and indistinguishable to every other term here.
                      Preference only: bounded well above zero (edge_style.STYLE_FLOOR),
                      applied AFTER anti-reverse / novelty / goal so it can lean those
                      terms but never overturn them, and absent (or unstyled) it leaves
                      every weight byte-identical to the pre-style behaviour.

Pure + import-safe (stdlib only). Imported by the 10fps render loop, so it must stay
fast and side-effect free. Never strands: if every candidate masks out, it falls back to
a uniform pick over the raw out-edges, so a panel can never freeze.
