"""pathfind.py -- shortest-path traversal over the video graph's TRANSITION edges.

The walker moves between poses by playing TRANSITION clips (kind="transition",
from-pose -> to-pose). To send a character from where it is now to a goal pose
chosen by the mind (director/heartbeat.py), we need the next transition to play
on a shortest path. That's a plain BFS over the transition sub-graph.

This is the read-side twin of VideoGraph._reachable_from (video_graph.py): same
walk, but it remembers the FIRST edge taken so the walker can play exactly one
hop, land, and ask again -- so the character visibly walks there step by step.

Pure + import-safe (stdlib only). Operates on the flat edge list the walker
already holds (GraphCycler.self.all), so it needs no VideoGraph object.

    from runtime import pathfind
    edge = pathfind.next_step(all_edges, "phineas:anchor", "phineas:glower")
    edge["label"]  # -> "a2g" : play this, land on glower, then ask again
