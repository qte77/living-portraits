"""
behavior_select.py -- personality-driven idle-behaviour picker for the player.

A living portrait idles by playing one behaviour loop per cycle (Phineas
*declaims*, then *wounded_sulk*s, then a resentful *side_eye_rival*...). WHICH
behaviour plays each cycle is the dynamic part of the "literal personality"
model (prompts/LIVING_PORTRAITS_PROMPT_SPEC.md sec.dynamic): the character JSON
gives each behaviour a base `weight` under motion.idle_behaviors, and the
director's current mood (data/mood.json) bends those weights via the character's
dynamic.mood_reweights. This module is the consume path for that contract.

What it does, in one call::

    chosen_clip, behavior_id = pick_behavior("phineas", graph_or_clips)

  1. load_character("phineas")          -> the JSON spec (cached by mtime)
  2. current_mood()                     -> data/mood.json's mood (safe default)
  3. match the character's idle_behaviors to the behaviour-tagged LOOP clips
     actually available (a ClipGraph or a plain clip iterable -- whichever the
     player hands us), keeping only behaviours that have a baked/stubbed loop
  4. weight each candidate by its base weight * mood_reweight[mood], normalise,
     and draw one with `rng` (default: the module's own random.Random)
  5. return (clip, behavior_id), or None when no behaviour loop exists yet

Design constraints (this module is imported by the LIVE player loop):

  * IMPORT-SAFE with NEITHER pygame NOR torch NOR numpy installed, and with no
    network and no GPU. The only hard dep is the stdlib. `Clip`/`ClipGraph`
    types are duck-typed (we read `.tags`, `.from_node`, `.to_node`,
    `.loopable`, `.neighbors()`/`.edges()`); we do NOT import clip_graph at
    module top level, so a missing/!broken runtime never stops the player from
    importing this. Optional imports are guarded.
  * SIDE-EFFECT-FREE on import: no file reads, no clock, no RNG seeding at
    import time. Everything happens inside the functions.
  * GRACEFUL: every "not ready yet" path returns a safe default (None / the
    base weights / the default mood) rather than raising, because the show is
    running and a half-built clip library must not crash a render frame.

Behaviour-loop contract (how a behaviour clip is recognised)
------------------------------------------------------------
Per phineas.json.dynamic.render_pseudocode, the bake registers each idle
behaviour as a self-loop edge on the anchor pose, tagged with the behaviour id::

    clip_graph.add_edge(anchor_node -> anchor_node, clip, tags=[behavior.id])

So a clip is "the loop for behaviour B of character C" when it is a held loop
(from_node == to_node, i.e. an anchor self-loop) AND its tags identify both the
behaviour id B and -- when present -- the character C. We match leniently: a
behaviour id may appear as a bare tag ("declaim"), a namespaced tag
("behavior:declaim" / "behaviour:declaim"), and the character as "character:<slug>"
(the convention pipeline/orchestrate.py already stamps). A clip with no
character tag is accepted for any character (single-character graphs); a clip
whose character tag names a DIFFERENT slug is rejected. This tolerates the
clip-graph invariant of one-clip-per-ordered-pair: behaviour loops that cannot
all be `idle->idle` may live as distinct anchor self-loops or be handed in as a
plain clip list -- either way we key on tags, not on the (from,to) slot.

Run `python runtime/behavior_select.py --selftest` to exercise the weighting +
mood-reweight math on synthetic data (no files, no clip graph, no deps).
