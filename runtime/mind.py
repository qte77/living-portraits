"""mind.py -- LLM-INTENT layer over the video-graph walk (daytime goal-seeking).

Sibling of circadian.py, SAME decide() shape. Where circadian forces the walker
toward a fixed nightly goal (sleep), the mind forces it toward a goal POSE chosen
by the heartbeat brain (director/heartbeat.py, GLM) and published to
data/mind/intent.json. The walker consults the mind ONLY by day -- circadian wins
at night (sleep is non-negotiable), and if the mind has no opinion the caller's
normal random walk runs unchanged. Precedence in the walker:

    circadian (clock)  >  mind (LLM intent)  >  random walk (fallback)

How a "want" becomes motion: the heartbeat writes {goal: "phineas:glower"}; on each
pick the mind runs pathfind(current -> goal) and FORCES the next transition; the
character lands one pose closer and asks again -- a visible step-by-step walk. At
the goal it PINS on idle loops until the heartbeat sets a new goal.

Design contract (avoids cross-writer races):
  * intent.json  -- the HEARTBEAT is the sole writer; the walker only reads.
  * pose/<char>.json -- each panel's walker is the sole writer; the heartbeat reads.

Resilience: a goal older than `max_age` (a dead/blocked heartbeat) is IGNORED, so the
portraits degrade to the lively random walk instead of freezing at a stale goal.

Pure + import-safe (stdlib only). The network/LLM lives in director/, never here:
this module is imported by the 10fps render loop and must stay fast + side-effect free.
