"""
clip_graph.py -- the clip library as a directed graph of poses and transitions.

A living portrait performs by walking a graph:

    nodes = poses  (the 7 stage-manager ACTIONS)
    edges = clips  (a baked transition / held-loop video between two poses)

The stage-manager writes a beat whose `action` names a *target pose*. The
player asks this graph for the shortest sequence of clips that gets the rig
from where it currently stands to that target, then hands that sequence to the
ClipPlayer. A self-loop edge (from_node == to_node) is the held "idle on this
pose" loop the rig plays while waiting for the next beat.

Clips are produced offline by the generative pipeline (img2vid + RIFE) and only
admitted to the library after the verify gate (SSIM continuity / loopable /
ID / register). Until a real clip exists for an edge, the edge may carry
`asset=None` -- a SYNTHETIC placeholder the player can still render, and
`missing_edges()` surfaces exactly which transitions the director must still
ask the pipeline to generate.

The library persists as a JSON manifest under data/clips/manifest.json. That
directory is the KV-index: each clip's metadata is one row; the actual mp4 /
png-sequence sits beside it. (`data/` is gitignored runtime state by design.)

No pygame, no opencv here -- this module is pure stdlib so it imports and tests
anywhere. Frame decode + blit live in clip_player.py.
