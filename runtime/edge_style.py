"""edge_style.py -- MANNER and VALENCE for a graph edge, derived from its own prose.

The audit's finding is blunt: the edge type system is ONE BIT. `kind` is `idle` or
`transition` and both mean "a playable video clip" (`_audit/CONTEXT_GRAPH_AUDIT.md (internal)`
S1.1, S3). The `tags` field, the one place edge semantics could live, holds
`[kind, label, kind]` and no runtime module reads it. Every claim about typed edges
carrying relational semantics is currently describing somebody else's system.

The type information was never missing. It was sitting in `motion_prompt`, the text
that was actually sent to the video generator, unread by anything at runtime:

    "the tragedian unbends from his glare and settles back square into the seated rest"
    "Body snaps forward from the relaxed slump, hand jerking up to claw at the air"

Those two clips are both `kind: transition`. One is a `drift`, one is a `surge`. This
module reads that prose and returns the difference, so `policy.weigh` can prefer a
manner the current mood would actually choose.

WHAT IT DERIVES
    manner   -- one of MANNERS (10), or None when the prose carries no movement verb
                this lexicon knows. None is a real answer, not a bucket: an edge with
                no manner gets multiplier 1.0 and behaves exactly as it does today.
    valence  -- roughly -1..+1. The manner's own base tone, adjusted by any affect
                words in the prose ("resentful", "triumphant"). Affect words are rare
                in the real corpus (~20 edges each at best), so the manner carries most
                of it and the affect lexicon only nudges.

THE REVERSE-PROSE TRAP (why `index()` exists and `derive()` alone is not enough)
    `video_graph.py:423,480,501` builds a reverse edge's prompt as `"(reverse) " + motion`
    where `motion` is the FORWARD clip's text. So on 316 of the 1,472 real edges the prose
    narrates the OPPOSITE direction of travel, and a naive read types a rise as a collapse.
    The marker alone is not the discriminator -- ~36 hand-authored `(reverse)` entries in
    `video_graph.py:337-365` do describe their own direction. `index()` settles it from the
    data instead of the marker: a marked edge is inverted only when an UNMARKED edge going
    the other way carries the identical text. Directional manners flip (collapse<->rise,
    reach<->recoil); the rest are their own inverse (a bow run backwards is still a
    flourish, a glitch backwards is still a dissolve).

DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
    No LLM at runtime -- `policy.weigh` is called by the 10fps render loop. No embeddings
    over a 600-word motion vocabulary. No write-back into the graph: this is derived at
    READ time from a field the pipeline already wrote, so nothing has to be regenerated
    and no snapshot has to be migrated.

Pure + import-safe (stdlib only), same contract as `journal_score.py`.
