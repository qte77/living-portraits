# AGENTS.md — working on this repo with a coding agent

For Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Aider, or any agent you point at this tree. Read
this before the first edit. Humans: everything here is true for you too, it is
just written for something that will happily make 40 correct-looking changes
before anyone notices the invariant it broke.

This file is the short version. [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) is the long
one, written against the live production host with every claim cited
`file.py:line`.

---

## Orient first

```bash
uv sync
python -m pytest tests/ -q                 # expect: 303 passed, 41 skipped
python scripts/seed_demo_media.py          # placeholder media, ~118 files
python runtime/video_graph.py build        # expect: 20 nodes, 98 edges, 0 errors
python scripts/export_context_view.py
```

If that chain is green you have a complete, walkable system with none of the
project's real art. If it is not green, stop and say so — do not begin the task
you were given on top of a broken baseline.

Then read ARCHITECTURE.md's **"If you read nothing else"** list. Ten numbered
facts; they are load-bearing and several of them are counterintuitive.

## The five rules that are not expressible in code

A test suite cannot catch these. They are the ones to hold in your head.

**1. Every shared file has exactly one writer.** That is the entire concurrency
design — two loops run on independent timers with no lock between them, and they
are safe only because no file is ever written from both sides. Adding a second
writer to any file under `data/` is the way to break this system, and it will not
fail immediately or reproducibly. If your change needs to write somewhere another
component already writes, that is a design conversation, not an implementation
detail.

**2. The walker's import set is pure stdlib and must stay import-safe.** The 10
fps render loop imports `circadian`, `lived`, `mind`, `policy` and — soft, in a
try/except — `edge_style`, and `mind` pulls in `pathfind`. It does NOT import
`video_graph`: it reads the built JSON. A network call, an LLM client, or a
heavy dependency introduced into any of those is a stutter on a physical wall.
Everything with a socket or a model in it lives in `director/`. This line is
real and it is not negotiable for convenience.

Note the scope: it is those seven modules, not the whole directory. `runtime/`
also holds the rendering half — `rig`, `clip_player`, `stage_render`,
`crossframe`, `rig_loop`, `capture_demo` — which imports numpy and cv2 at module
level and always has. ARCHITECTURE.md's module table marks each file PURE or
HEAVY; that table is the authority, and this rule is about the PURE ones.

**3. Walk-safety is enforced at build, and the build refusing to save is correct
behaviour.** Every pose needs a way out: idle loops plus at least one transition
back toward its hub. `runtime/video_graph.py build` will refuse to write a graph
that would strand or trap the walker. Do not "fix" that error by relaxing the
check — a trapped walker is a character frozen in one pose on a wall in a public
space, and nobody will notice for a week.

**4. Absence is a skip with a reason, never a pass and never an error.** The
`test_real_*` tests measure against a 66-day production snapshot that is not in
this repo. On a bare clone they skip and say why. If you find yourself making one
of them pass by pointing it at a fixture, you have deleted the only tests in the
suite whose numbers nobody chose. Same rule in `health/`: cannot-see is FAIL,
never PASS.

**5. Detection never repairs.** A `health/` detector reports; something else,
under its own policy, acts. Merging the two lets a repair quietly redefine what
"healthy" means.

## Where things are

| You want to change… | Go to | Watch out for |
|---|---|---|
| How a character chooses its next pose | `runtime/policy.py`, `runtime/circadian.py` | Precedence is **circadian > mind (LLM goal) > walk**. Circadian answers first and *returns on a force* — after dark the bedtime chain owns the body and the policy weights are never consulted at all. |
| The graph itself — poses, clips, edges | `runtime/video_graph.py` | `NODE_SPECS` / `EDGE_SPECS` are the source of truth. Edges are **discovered by globbing clips on disk**, so a spec with no media silently produces no edge. |
| What a character remembers | `runtime/lived.py`, `runtime/journal_score.py`, `director/reflect.py` | Journals are append-only and single-writer. |
| The viewer | `graph_viewer.html`, `scripts/export_context_view.py` | The export is **read-only over production by contract**: never call `build()`, never write back into `video_graph.json`, never touch a journal. |
| Watching a walk happen | `scripts/live_view.py` | Runs the real walker headless (with `--policy`, so it publishes `pose/<char>.json` like the wall does) plus the exporter on a timer. Pass `--no-walker` to drop that writer and just re-run the exporter on whatever is already there. |
| Clip generation | `pipeline/` | Needs a CUDA GPU and `requirements-gen.txt`. Almost certainly not your task. |
| Panel geometry or colour | `panels.yaml` | Config, not code. Do not hardcode a rect. |
| What the system reads from the environment | `install/ENVIRONMENT.md` | All 28 variables with defaults. Secrets have a file fallback under `~/.config/living-portraits/` or `data/mind/`; never commit one. |

**`_preview_graph.py` is the production player**, despite the `_preview_` prefix
that groups it with throwaway demos. It is what the `lp-preview` scheduled task
runs; `player.py` is the parked v2 path. Do not rename it: `stop_portraits.ps1`,
`lp_watchdog_preview.ps1` and `start_portraits.ps1` all match it as a **literal
string** in a running command line, as does the registered task action. Renaming
it is a coordinated host-side change, not a refactor.

`runtime/clip_graph.py` is an **older parallel v2 graph** used only by the parked
player path. `runtime/video_graph.py` is the live one. They look similar and they
are not interchangeable — check which one your caller actually uses.

## Verifying a change

1. `python -m pytest tests/ -q` — the count must not go down, and a test that
   flipped from pass to skip is a regression wearing a disguise.
2. `python runtime/video_graph.py build` — if you touched the graph, poses, or
   specs. Zero walk-safety errors.
3. `python scripts/export_context_view.py` then reload the viewer — if you
   touched anything the six lenses read.
4. **Check the thing, not something adjacent to it.** Every green signal here can
   be green while the thing is broken: `pytest` exits 0 having collected nothing,
   a static server answers 200 for a page whose JavaScript died before drawing,
   and `capture_demo --selftest` proves the compositor without running the
   walker. Both bugs found in the 2026-09 pass were invisible for the same
   reason — the check was a proxy. Run the walker; open the page.
5. For anything visual, **probe the DOM, do not eyeball a screenshot.** A CSS bug
   in this repo's history stacked a label and its percentage at the same x; it
   was found by comparing two elements' bounding boxes and would not have been
   found by looking. Screenshots confirm; they do not falsify — but take one
   anyway, because it is how you learn there is something to probe.
   `scripts/e2e_viewer.py` does both.

## Things that will waste your time

- **`data/` is gitignored and mostly absent.** That is deliberate. Run
  `scripts/seed_demo_media.py` rather than inventing fixtures, so you are working
  against the same graph shape everyone else is.
- **`pipeline/vendor/` is gitignored too** — InstantID and LivePortrait are not
  in this repo. Never run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from inside either of
  them: both pin transformers 4.38, which breaks diffusers and takes the whole
  generation stack down.
- **`health/` is an operator tool, not a contributor tool.** `checks.py` SSHes to
  the production host (`HOST = "hil"`, `health/checks.py:29`) and reports on the
  live installation; `oracle.yaml` additionally hardcodes an absolute interpreter
  path from that host. Without access to `hil` both simply fail to connect —
  nothing here reads your local checkout. Read `health/README.md` for what the
  nine detectors mean; do not expect to run them.
- **The Midjourney generation path is retired but intact.** It has returned HTTP
  403 on every upload since 2026-07-02. Higgsfield replaced it. Do not debug it.
- **`data/clips/video_graph.live.json`**, if you ever see one, is a stale local
  artifact that does not exist in production. Ignore it.
- **This repo is generated, not authored.** It is a curated subset of a private
  monorepo, and `scripts/release.py sync` copies private → public, deleting any
  file that exists only here (`OSS_ONLY` is just `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`). A
  change landed only in this repo is reverted, silently, on the next release.
  Land it in the private tree, or add the path to `OSS_ONLY` there.
- **You do not need Windows to run the walker.** `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy` runs the
  real `_preview_graph.py` with the production flags on any OS — pygame blits
  every frame to a memory buffer instead of an LED card. What is Windows-first is
  pinning a borderless window at desktop origin so a sending card can grab
  sub-rects out of it. That is hardware plumbing, not the system.

## Writing

Docstrings in this repo say *why*, and several of them exist specifically to stop
someone re-deriving a wrong answer that already cost a day. The CHANGELOG retracts
its own earlier claims by name when they turn out to be false. Match that: if you
find something in a comment or a doc that is not true any more, correcting it is
part of the change, not a separate chore.

Do not add a claim you have not checked. "Should work" belongs in a commit
message, not in a docstring.
