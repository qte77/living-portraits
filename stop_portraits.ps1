# stop_portraits.ps1 -- one-click STOP for the Living Portraits show on desktop-hil08rd.
#
# Double-click "Stop Living Portraits" on the Desktop. Takes the show DOWN and KEEPS it down.
# The self-heal (the lp-watchdog-preview task + heartbeat._ensure_player) both RESPECT a
# Disabled task, so the off-switch is a strict 3-phase teardown:
#   A) DISABLE both lp-mind + lp-preview FIRST -- with both off-switches set, neither the
#      watchdog nor a last heartbeat tick can repop a panel while we tear the run down. (The
#      old order disabled the player before the brain, leaving a window where the still-live
#      brain's _ensure_player could /Run the player right back.)
#   B) END the running instances (Stop-ScheduledTask, brain before player).
#   C) FORCE-KILL any pythonw that didn't wind down -- Stop-ScheduledTask only ends
#      task-tracked runs, so an orphaned player would otherwise keep painting the panels.
#
# Then it RE-QUERIES the truth (task State + both processes) and reports DOWN only when it's
# really down. It never prints "disabled" it didn't verify: a Disable can be silently refused
# if the task runs under a principal you can't edit without admin -- in that case it SAYS SO
# and tells you to Run as administrator, instead of lying while the watchdog repops the show.
#
# To bring it back: double-click "Start Living Portraits" (re-enables + starts everything).
# The stop PERSISTS across reboots until you hit Start -- that is the point. OllamaServe and
# lp-watchdog-preview are left running on purpose (both no-op on a disabled task).
