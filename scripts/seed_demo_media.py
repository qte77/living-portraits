"""seed_demo_media.py -- make a bare checkout walkable without any of our art.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`data/` is gitignored, and rightly so: the anchor stills and the motion clips are
generated art, hundreds of megabytes of it, and they are not what this repo is
about. But `runtime/video_graph.py build` discovers edges by globbing for those
clips on disk, so on a fresh clone it finds none, every pose ends up with no way
out, and the build refuses to save:

    ERROR: node phineas:anchor has NO outgoing edges -> the walk would strand here
    GRAPH NOT SAVED -- 21 walk-safety error(s).

That is the build being correct. It is also a wall: with no graph there is no
walk, no lived record, no context view, and the viewer opens on nothing. A
newcomer cannot see the system they were asked to work on.

This script writes PLACEHOLDER media -- flat colour cards with the pose name on
them, and short procedurally-animated loops -- one per still and per clip the
graph declares. It is enough for `build` to produce a real, walk-safe graph and
for every downstream surface to have something to show. It is not art and does
not pretend to be: every frame says PLACEHOLDER on it.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
-------------------
It never overwrites a file that already exists. That is the whole safety story,
and it is why this is safe to run on the production host by accident: real media
is simply skipped. `--force` overwrites. It writes only under `data/gen/` and
`data/clips/_proto/`, both gitignored.

WHERE THE SPECS COME FROM
-------------------------
NODE_SPECS and EDGE_SPECS are imported from `runtime.video_graph`, not restated
here -- a second copy of that table would drift the first time someone adds a
pose, and the seeder would then quietly under-seed the graph it exists to fill.

The bedtime chain is read separately from `prompts/bedtime_routine.json`. It has
to be: `video_graph` merges a character's bedtime beats only once every clip that
character declares already exists, so on a first run those edges are not yet in
EDGE_SPECS to be seen. Seeding straight from the spec closes that loop in one
pass -- which matters, because the circadian layer is what the Decision lens is
looking at after dark.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/seed_demo_media.py            # seed what is missing
    python scripts/seed_demo_media.py --dry-run  # say what it would write
    python scripts/seed_demo_media.py --force    # overwrite existing media

Then:
    python runtime/video_graph.py build
    python scripts/export_context_view.py

Requires Pillow (a pyproject.toml dependency). ASCII only, no network.
