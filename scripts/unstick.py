"""unstick.py -- give a cul-de-sac pose a second way out, chosen by measured cost.

56 of Phineas's 120 poses have one exit or none, and the same for 56 of MAXX's 138. That is
autogen's star topology: every new pose is a spur off a hub, so its only exit is the reverse
of the clip that got you there. Under a low-energy band the walk then sits there.

`runtime/policy.ESCAPE_VELOCITY` already fixes the SYMPTOM for free -- exits get more
attractive the longer a character has been somewhere, which covers all 112 spurs including
ones that do not exist yet. This script fixes the TOPOLOGY, which is a different thing: a
second real edge means somewhere else to go, not just a stronger pull toward the one door.

IT SPENDS REAL CREDITS, so it spends them where the traversal record says the time actually
goes. Fixing all 112 is ~840 credits, 28% of a month, to reclaim dwell whose worst single
member is 1.1% of a life. Ranked by measured dwell x visits, the top handful is ~5%.

Mechanism is autogen's own: append an `extra_links` entry to the pose's record in
data/mind/autogen_poses.json and generate the pair. `video_graph._autogen_additions` already
emits link edges in BOTH directions, gated on both gifs existing, dropping anything dangling
-- so a failed generation cannot strand the walk. No new graph code.

    python scripts/unstick.py                      # ranked plan + credit cost (SAFE default)
    python scripts/unstick.py --apply --limit 1    # generate for the worst one
