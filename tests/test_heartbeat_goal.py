"""test_heartbeat_goal.py -- the brain names a pose; the walker needs a node id.

Regression cover for the FROZEN-PORTRAITS bug (found on hil 2026-07-31): the goal
menu lists "phineas:withered_rose" but the model answers "withered_rose", the old
exact-membership test scored that a miss, and the character stayed put. 1170 of
1179 rejected decisions in the live log were this single mismatch.

Pure function, no graph / no network / no LLM.
