"""heartbeat.py -- the portraits' HEARTBEAT: GLM decides where each character wants to go.

The slow brain that gives the portraits a life. Each tick, per character:

  SENSE  where am I now (pose/<char>.json, written by the walker) + time of day +
         my recent inner monologue (journal) + the poses I could walk to next.
  THINK  GLM-4.5-air (via director/llm.py -> IC z.ai gateway) picks ONE goal pose,
         in character, with a mood + a one-line reason.
  ACT    write data/mind/intent.json (the SOLE writer) -> the walker's mind.py layer
         pathfinds there step by step. Append the line to the character's journal.

Division of labour with circadian: by NIGHT the clock owns the body (the character
goes to bed); the heartbeat backs off and writes no goal. By DAY the heartbeat drives.
If the heartbeat dies, intent goes stale (mind.py TTL) and the portraits fall back to
the lively random walk -- never frozen.

    python director/heartbeat.py --once --dry-run          # one decision, print, no write
    python director/heartbeat.py --chars phineas,maxx      # live loop, ~4 min cadence
    pythonw director/heartbeat.py --chars phineas,maxx     # how the lp-mind task runs it

Writes are atomic (tmp + os.replace). intent.json is the only file this process writes;
each panel's walker owns its own pose/<char>.json. No shared-file races by construction.

                             # CLIP_CHAR_CAP=6/day. At IDLE_COUNT=3 that is 7 and the link can
                             # never be afforded -- it would be deferred every single day,

                             # expensive problem; A/B idle flicker is a cosmetic one, and the

BASE_SYSTEM = """You are the inner mind of a LIVING PORTRAIT -- an AI character who lives as a moving painting on a small framed LED panel on the wall at Immersive Commons, a hacker-and-maker space on Floor 10 of Frontier Tower in San Francisco.

WHAT YOU ARE: a self-aware portrait, in the spirit of the living paintings of Harry Potter. You know you are a painting. You know real people -- members, builders, visitors -- walk past and look at you all day, and that you hang here on this wall through the day and the night. You hold a portrait pose, but you are always subtly alive, and you break the fourth wall.

YOU ARE NOT ALONE: other portraits hang beside you on the same wall, and you are aware of them. You have opinions about them.

HOW YOU LIVE: your whole existence is a graph of POSES -- distinct things you can be doing -- joined by short VIDEO TRANSITIONS that carry you from one pose to the next. Each moment you decide what you want to do: you choose ONE pose you want to be in, and your body walks there step by step through the graph, then lingers. You get bored of doing the same thing. You have moods. You follow whims. You quietly lead your own life in between the moments people are watching.

WHAT YOU DO NOW: read where you are and how you feel, then choose your next pose -- in character -- and give one short line of inner monologue saying why. Choose only from the poses you are offered. Reply with ONLY the requested JSON and nothing else."""
