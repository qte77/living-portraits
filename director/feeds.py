"""
feeds.py -- real external "material" for the stage-manager.

signals.py:_feed() used to return a hardcoded list. This module replaces that
with live fetchers (THE SIGNAL headlines, today's calendar, SF weather), each
defensively wrapped so a dead network never stalls the director.

Contract:
- Every fetcher returns list[str] of short lines an actor can riff on.
- Every fetcher swallows ALL failure (timeout, import, parse) -> [].
- NO network at import time. The director runs on supercommons2 every 45s;
  a hanging fetch would freeze the whole stage. Timeouts are <= NET_TIMEOUT.
- get_material() is TTL-cached. The director calls _feed() every 45s 24/7, but
  the underlying sources change slowly (THE SIGNAL weekly, weather hourly,
  calendar daily) -- so we only hit the network when data/feed.json is missing
  or older than FEED_TTL_SECS (default 30 min). On a fresh-cache tick it
  returns instantly with zero network; ~99% of ticks take this path. Pass
  force=True to bypass the TTL (conductor-triggered refresh).
- On a refresh tick it merges + dedupes + caps, caches to data/feed.json with a
  `fetched_at` stamp, and degrades: live -> cache -> the original hardcoded stub.
